# Dialogue Summarization using FlanT5 with AWS

### Summarize_dialogue-FLAN-T5.ipynb
In this Notebook, we will summarize dialogue using generative AI. Let's explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task we need the model to do. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, learning prompt engineering and see the enhancement of the generative output of Large Language Models.  

### fine_tune_Summarize_dialogue.ipynb
In this notebook we will be fine tuning the above summarize dialouges using Full Fine Tuning(FFT) and Parameter Efficiency Fine Tuning(PEFT) using LoRA( Low Rank Adaptation to make the outputs better and compare all the tuned models and orginal models using ROUGE score.
