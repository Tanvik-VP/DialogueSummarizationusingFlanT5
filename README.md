# DialougeSummarizationusingFlanT5

### Summarize_dialogue-FLAN-T5.ipynb
In this Notbook, we will summarize dialogue using generative AI. Let's explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task we need the model to do. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, learning prompt engineering and see the enhancement of the generative output of Large Language Models.
